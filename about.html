We ensure full GDPR compliance for all data handling, storage, and processing, particularly concerning sensitive user inputs like organizational budgets and threat profiles.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Development & Validation</h2>
        <p>Following an agile, iterative development process, we continuously validate the tool's effectiveness through comprehensive case studies and comparisons against established cybersecurity optimization models. Iterative usability testing ensures an intuitive user experience informed by stakeholder feedback.</p>
